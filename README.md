# Overview

Through this project we aim to create a service for students willing to start learning Japanese language and culture that helps them enjoy learning Japanese online, outside of the classroom. This repository is a successor of the previous version of this project based on pure html, css, and javascript (hereinafter [SKGO Japanese v1](https://skgojapanese.com/)). It is important to note that this project is a collaborative effort with the [Gardena Valley Japanese Cultural Institute](https://www.jci-gardena.org/) Japanese Language School (hereinafter [JCI Japanese Language School](https://www.jci-gardena.org/japanese-language-school.html)). Our contents are provided by the Japanese language school teachers and volunteers.
